# BiOcularGAN Synthetic Datasets

This repository contains synthetic datasets generated with the BiOcularGAN framework. <br> 
These datasets were used to conduct the experiments in the paper: <br>

**BiOcularGAN: Bimodal Synthesis and Annotation of Ocular Images**<br>
Darian Tomašević, Peter Peer, Vitomir Štruc<br>
Published as part of the International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB) 2022. 

## Obtaining and using the datasets
To use the synthetic datasets, please fill out and sign the [form](https://github.com/dariant/BiOcularGAN_synthetic_datasets/blob/main/BiOcularGAN%20Licence%20Agreement.docx) and send it to Darian Tomašević at darian.tomasevic@gmail.com <br>
Due to the size of the datasets, they are available at the following OneDrive [link](https://unilj-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/dt9845_student_uni-lj_si/EswVcs1lrLRFjLi-m7b6MxYBUgHcirRRPeN11O9nxwOjzA?e=fw4zlP).
